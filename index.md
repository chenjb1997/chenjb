## About me

My name is Jingbang Chen. I am currently pursuing Ph.D of Computer Science at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) under the guidance of [Richard Peng](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rpeng/).

Prior to this, I received B.Eng (Honors) in the Pursuit Science Class (Computer Science) at [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/) (Joint Program with [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/)), [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/).

I am highly involved with Competitive Programming since high school. I received a Bronze Medal in National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2015.

I won 12 gold medals in ICPC/CCPC series competitions including the very first Regional Champion of Zhejiang University in 2017 and the Provincial Champion in 2018. On behalf of Zhejiang University, I participated in ICPC World Finals held in Beijing, 2018. I am International Grandmaster at [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/chenjb) (Max Rating 2735).
