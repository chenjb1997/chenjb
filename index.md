## About me

My name is Jingbang Chen. I am currently pursuing Ph.D of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology under the guidance of Richard Peng.

Prior to this, I received B.Eng (Honors) in the Pursuit Science Class (Computer Science) at Chu Kochen Honors College (Joint Program with College of Computer Science and Technology), Zhejiang University.

I am highly involved with Competitive Programming since high school. I received a Bronze Medal in National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI) in 2015. Then I joined the Competitive Programming Team of Zhejiang University and served as the team leader of Team Legilimens (2017-2019) and the student co-coach (2018-2019). I won 12 gold medals in ICPC/CCPC series competitions including the very first Regional Champion of Zhejiang University in 2017 and the Provincial Champion in 2018. On behalf of Zhejiang University, I participated in ICPC World Finals held in Beijing, 2018. I am International Grandmaster at Codeforces (Max Rating 2735). I also work as a problem setter, judge or advisor for multiple competitions and training camp.
